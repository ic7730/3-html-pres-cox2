                    <p>- Oceans cover three quarters of the Earth’s surface, contain 97 per cent of the Earth’s water, and represent 99 per cent of the living space on the planet by volume. Separate studies from 2013 suggest as many as 50 percent of sea turtles are ingesting plastic at an unprecedented rate, and dying because of it. Another study of the Loggerhead species found that 15 percent of young turtles examined had ingested such enormous quantities of plastic that their digestive system was obstructed.

                    <p>
                        Oceans provide key natural
                        resources including
                        food, medicines, biofuels
                        and other products. They
                        help with the breakdown
                        and removal of waste and
                        pollution, and their coastal
                        ecosystems act as buffers
                        to reduce damage from
                        storms. Maintaining healthy
                        oceans supports climate
                        change mitigation and
                        adaptation efforts. And
                        have you been to the seaside?
                        It’s also a great place
                        for tourism and recreation.</p>

                        <p>
                            By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution
                            By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans
                            Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels
                            By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics
                            By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information
                            By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation
                            By 2030, increase the economic benefits to Small Island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism
                            Increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, taking into account the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology, in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries, in particular small island developing States and least developed countries
                            Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets
                            Enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in UNCLOS, which provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources, as recalled in paragraph 158 of The Future We Want

            <h1>The problem</h1>

            <p>
                Increasing levels of debris
                in the world’s oceans are
                having a major environmental
                and economic
                impact. Marine debris
                impacts biodiversity
                through entanglement or
                ingestion of debris items by
                organisms, which can kill
                them or make it impossible
                for them to reproduce.
                As far as the world’s coral
                reefs are concerned, about
                20 per cent of them have
                been effectively destroyed
                and show no prospects
                for recovery. About 24 per
                cent of the remaining reefs
                are under imminent risk of
                collapse through human
                pressures, and a further 26
                per cent are under a longer
                -term threat of collapse. Furthermore, improper
                marine management
                results in overfishing.
                The lost economic benefits
                from the fisheries
                sector are estimated to
                be around US$50 billion
                annually. The UN
                Environment Programme
                estimates the cumulative
                economic impact of poor
                ocean management practices
                is at least US$200
                billion per year. In the absence of mitigation
                measures, climate change
                will increase the cost of
                damage to the ocean by
                an additional US$322
                billion per year by 2050.  </p>

            <h1>So what can we do?</h1>

            <p>
                For open ocean and deep
                sea areas, sustainability
                can be achieved only
                through increased international
                cooperation to
                protect vulnerable habitats.
                Establishing comprehensive,
                effective and
                equitably managed systems
                of government-protected
                areas should be
                pursued to conserve
                biodiversity and ensure a sustainable future for
                the fishing industry.
                On a local level, we should
                make ocean-friendly
                choices when buying products
                or eating food derived
                from oceans and consume
                only what we need.
                Selecting certified products
                is a good place to start.
                Making small changes
                in our daily lives, like
                taking public transport
                and unplugging electronics
                saves energy.
                These actions reduce
                our carbon footprint, a
                factor that contributes
                to rising sea levels.
                We should eliminate
                plastic usage as much
                as possible and organize
                beach clean-ups.
                Most importantly, we
                can spread the message about how important
                marine life is and why
                we need to protect it. </p>
